Repository Name: Telecom Customer Churn Prediction and Analysis

Description:

Welcome to the Telecom Customer Churn Prediction and Analysis repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for predicting customer churn in the telecom industry, with a specific focus on understanding the reasons behind churn in relation to the services offered.

Key Features:

Churn Prediction Model:

Implement a robust machine learning model to predict customer churn based on historical data.
Utilize advanced algorithms such as KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks for accurate predictions.
Feature Importance Analysis:

Identify and analyze the key features that significantly contribute to customer churn.
Gain insights into the specific services, pricing plans, and customer interactions that impact churn rates.
Interactive Visualization:

Create interactive visualizations to present the findings and insights from the churn prediction model.
Use tools like Plotly or Matplotlib to create dynamic charts and graphs for better understanding.
Data Preprocessing and Cleaning:

Develop robust data preprocessing pipelines to handle missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.
Ensure the dataset is prepared for accurate model training and analysis.
Explanatory Model Deployment:

Deploy an explanatory model to help stakeholders understand the factors influencing churn in a transparent and interpretable manner.
Provide documentation on how to use the model for predictions.
Documentation:
